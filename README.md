This is test version of the Home Assistant VeSync integration.  Edited to add support for the Levoit Core200S air purifier.  Testing with HA core-2021.4.6

Copy the 'vesync' subdirectory into your '/config/custom_components/' directory.
Note: Doing this will/should override an existing VeSync integration.
